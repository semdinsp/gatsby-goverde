### Assist and empower the marketing team

We want to allow small marketing teams to grow and focus on what is important by refining their activities away from reporting and into strategy. We want to take performance reporting for the team and turn it into a beneficial and thought provoking activity.

### App Support

Our 'flutter' delivers an elegant experience across both Android and iOS devices.  The applications allows users to add activities (print, digital, video) and coordinate performance metrics.

### Use Case

We want to give the marketing team a common way to communicate internally  plus a simple way to provide reporting.  We structure our software around the concept of a team and team members.  You can be a member of many teams.  We believe marketing department can use this directly inside their organizations.  In additions consultants, ad agencies, and other strategic organization can create teams aligned with their customers  and have a common tool to manage the interaction with the customer.
